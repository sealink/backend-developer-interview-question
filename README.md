# Problem

## Description

You have been put in charge of designing and building the new SpeedCo Bus
system. This is a critical piece of infrastructure for SpeedCo, it must handle
registering their fleet of buses, setting up lines as a series of routes
(usually two, a forward and a return), setting up routes as a series of stops,
and scheduling those buses to run lines at certain times.

## Requirements

Your system must allow:
  - Adding and removing buses with their registration (eg: ABC-123)
  - Adding and removing stops with their code (eg: A1, B3, Q42)
  - Adding and removing routes with their name (eg: M44, H22, G40)
  - Adding and removing lines
  - Scheduling lines to a bus for a given time

Your submitted program must setup at least one bus with a line assigned to it.

Please include a README with what's required for your application (eg: Python
3.10, OpenJDK 16.0.2, Ruby 3.0.2), how to compile (if required), and how to run
it.

## Task

Design and implement a model of the system in a programming language of your
choice.
